# SteelEye Frontend Engineer Assignment

## 1. Explain what the simple List component does.
The useMemo Hook can be used to keep expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running. In this example, we have an expensive function that runs on every render. When changing the count or adding a todo, you will notice a delay in execution.

## 2. What problems / warnings are there with code?
  - a. prop-types is not install in the default react. We have to install it with using npm.
  - b. Added the dummy values in the Default Props.
  - c. array and shapeOf is not any function in the Props.
  - d. There is an extra comma in the propType defination.

## 3. Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.
  - a. Added Dummy Data for testing
  - b. Installed prop-types module.
